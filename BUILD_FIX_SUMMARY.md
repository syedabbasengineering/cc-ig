# Vercel Build Error - Resolution Summary

## Problem
Deployment to Vercel failed with npm peer dependency conflicts between `zod`, `openai`, `langsmith`, and `langchain` packages.

## Root Cause
Different packages in the dependency tree required conflicting versions of peer dependencies:
- `zod@3.25.76` was required by some packages
- `openai@^5.23.1` required `zod@"^3.23.8"`
- `langsmith` and `langchain` had conflicting peer dependency requirements

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. NPM Configuration (`.npmrc`)
Created `.npmrc` file with:
```ini
legacy-peer-deps=true
fetch-timeout=600000
fetch-retries=5
```

This forces npm to use legacy peer dependency resolution algorithm, which is more lenient with version conflicts.

### 2. Package.json Updates
- Added `postinstall` script to auto-generate Prisma client
- Added `vercel-build` script for Vercel-specific builds
- Added `resolutions` field to force compatible versions of indirect dependencies
- Removed conflicting `overrides` that referenced direct dependencies

### 3. Vercel Configuration
Updated `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "buildCommand": "npm run vercel-build"
}
```

### 4. Code Fixes

#### a. Zod Error Handling
```typescript
// Before
error.errors

// After
error.issues
```

#### b. Content Model Fields
```typescript
// Before
approvedAt: { gte: ... }

// After
updatedAt: { gte: ... }
```

#### c. Prisma Middleware
Removed deprecated `$use` middleware (not available in Prisma v6):
```typescript
// Removed: prismaWithPool.$use(...)
// Replaced with log configuration in PrismaClient init
```

#### d. Worker Manager
Made worker imports conditional/template-based since worker processor files don't exist yet.

## Verification

✅ **Local Build**: Successful
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# Route (app)                              Size
# ├ ○ /                                    5.38 kB
# ...
```

✅ **Git Push**: Successful
```bash
git push origin main
# To https://github.com/syedabbasengineering/cc-ig.git
#    e4e398f..3a0f123  main -> main
```

## Next Steps for Vercel Deployment

1. **Wait for Automatic Deployment**
   - Vercel will auto-deploy from GitHub push
   - Monitor at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Set Environment Variables** (if not already set)
   Required variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   NEXTAUTH_URL
   REDIS_URL
   OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   Once deployed, test:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health
   ```

4. **Check Build Logs**
   If deployment still fails:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Click on the deployment
   - Review build logs

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `.npmrc` (new)
- `package.json` (modified)
- `vercel.json` (modified)

### Code Fixes
- `app/api/upload/image/route.ts`
- `app/api/cron/backup-metrics/route.ts`
- `src/lib/db/connection-pool.ts`
- `src/workers/worker-manager.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### If Vercel build still fails:

**1. Clear Vercel Cache**
   - Settings → General → Build & Development Settings
   - Click "Clear Build Cache"
   - Redeploy

**2. Check Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Use "Production" environment
   - Restart deployment

**3. Review Build Logs**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Check if all dependencies installed
   - Verify Prisma client generated

**4. Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules .next
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run build
   ```

## Success Indicators

When deployment succeeds, you should see:
- ✅ Build completed
- ✅ Deployment successful
- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- ✅ Application accessible at your Vercel URL
